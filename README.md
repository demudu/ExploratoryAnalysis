"Data Science" Specialization
Johns Hopkins University
Exploratory Data Analysis

This is a submission for Project 1

Introduction
This assignment uses data from "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on the course web site:
Dataset: Electric power consumption
(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) [20Mb]
Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute
sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering
values are available.
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption):
1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the
kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas
powered).
8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the
laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3
